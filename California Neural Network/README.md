Multi-Layer Perceptron for California Housing Prices

Overview
This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch to predict California housing prices based on eight numerical features. The dataset is loaded using sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing and is preprocessed before training the model.

Features

*Implements an MLP model with batch normalization and dropout for stability.

*Uses PyTorch for model training and evaluation.

*Implements learning rate scheduling and early stopping.

*Normalizes dataset for better performance.

*Uses California Housing dataset from Scikit-Learn
