# Deck of Cards  

## Overview  
This project implements a deck of playing cards in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows for various card operations, including shuffling, cutting the deck, dealing cards, and sorting. The simulation demonstrates different shuffle techniques such as riffle shuffle and the "eight-out" shuffle.  

## Technology Used  
- **C++**  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- STL (Standard Template Library)  
- Randomization for shuffling  

## Features  
- **Card Class**: Represents an individual playing card with a suit, label, and value.  
- **Deck Class**: Implements a deck of 52 playing cards with the following functionalities:  
  - Deck creation  
  - Displaying the deck  
  - Splitting the deck  
  - Riffle shuffle  
  - Eight-out shuffle  
  - Sorting the deck  

## Usage Instructions  

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadrasheed03/Projects.git
   cd Projects/Deck\ of\ Cards
   ```

2. **Compile the program:**  
   ```bash
